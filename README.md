# Taberu-Food-Finder-Application

## Description:
Taberu is a Tinder-style application that leverages a user’s preferences through a swipe-basedmodel, that has become popular in many dating apps, where restaurants are showcased with reviews and images so the end user may make an informed decision regarding their meal choices. The user is then presented with custom tailored suggestions based on the information gathered from the swipe-based model. The application runs over a server, which provides the end-users (clients) with restaurants within a given radius (in miles) from the user’s current location. The user will swipe through different restaurants (left for no, right for yes) to indicate their preference for that restaurant. This information is given to the machine learning model so that it can learn what the user’s eating preferences are. This information is stored on the device and is always protected.
